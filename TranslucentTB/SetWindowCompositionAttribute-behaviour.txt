ACCENT_ENABLE_GRADIENT
  Simply sets the taskbar to the opaque color specified in nColor from --tint. Doesn't care about the alpha channel.

ACCENT_ENABLE_TRANSPARENTGRADIENT
  Also applies the alpha value of nColor to the taskbar. Inconsistent results arise when
  nColor is zero. One report from @charlesmilette is that it results in a completely transparent taskbar, as expected,
  but another (from @MrAksel) has seen that the taskbar displays as a solid color from the system color scheme (as selected
  in Personalization->Colors). There were also problems with the color not applying properly, and just turning solid
  white (though nColor was inspected and was not 0xFFFFFFFF).

ACCENT_ENABLE_BLURBEHIND
  Applies a blur to the content behind the taskbar. Inconsistent results in this mode too. 
  @MrAksel saw no effect from the nColor field, no matter the value, but @charlesmilette saw a tint applied,
  as expected.
