ACCENT_ENABLE_GRADIENT
  Simply sets the taskbar to the opaque color specified in nColor from --tint. Doesn't care about the alpha channel.

ACCENT_ENABLE_TRANSPARENTGRADIENT
  Also applies the alpha value of nColor to the taskbar. Inconsistent results arise when
  nColor is zero. One report from @charlesmilette is that it results in a completely transparent taskbar, as expected,
  but another (from @MrAksel) has seen that the taskbar displays as a solid color from the system color scheme (as selected
  in Personalization->Colors). There were also problems with the color not applying properly, and just turning solid
  white (though nColor was inspected and was not 0xFFFFFFFF). These issues were only observed on one of the two tested 
  computers, so we should probably ignore it if we don't get more issue reports.

ACCENT_ENABLE_BLURBEHIND
  Applies a blur to the content behind the taskbar. Inconsistent results in this mode too. 
  @MrAksel saw no effect from the nColor field (on one computer), no matter the value, but @charlesmilette saw a tint applied,
  as expected.

ACCENT_ENABLE_TINTED
  An internal helper for dynamic-ws which allows for dynamic windows to have tint and transparency simultaneously.

ACCENT_NORMAL_GRADIENT
  An internal helper that tells TranslucentTB to restore to the generic black translucent taskbar.
