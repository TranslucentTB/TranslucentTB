; There are 3 possible ways to exclude windows from the dynamic feature:
;
; Title of the window. This one checks if the title contains the substring instead of searching for an exact match
; example:
; title, Command Prompt
;
; Name of the .exe file
; example:
; exename, cmd.exe
;
; Window class name. Can be found with programs like Window Spy from AutoHotKeys or Spy++
; example
; class, ConsoleWindowClass
;
; As you might have noticed, all lines beginning with ";" is a comment.
; if you find dynamic windows is not working correctly
; uncomment the line below. Note: this will make dynamic windows not work for UWP apps
; exename, ApplicationFrameHost.exe
